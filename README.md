# Django-ecomm-ml_cython
This is a Ecommerce website created using Django Framework. The backend is completely handled by django and javascript, whereas for the frontend bootstrap was used. In addition to this I created a Recommendation model using collaborative filtering based on User's Likes and Dislikes. To make the recommendation model a little lighter Cython was used.

The functionalities include adding items to the cart, removing the items from the cart, checkout and payment with transaction id.
Using collaborative filtering functionalites such as Liking and Disliking according to user have been added.
To reduce the load cython was implemented.
