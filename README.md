# Django-ecomm-ml_cython
This is a Ecommerce website created using Django Framework. The backend is completely handled by django and javascript, whereas for the frontend bootstrap was used. In addition to this I created a Recommendation model using collaborative filtering based on User's Likes and Dislikes. To make the recommendation model a little lighter Cython was used.
